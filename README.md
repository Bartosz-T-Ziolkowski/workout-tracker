# Copilot Reflection
* In this project I incorporated copilot to help finish the lines of code as well as look at what suggestions it gave me and then decided whether or not I should accept them. One suggestion that I had from copilot that was not ideal was that I had recieved a 'useState' error which broke my project when I tried to write new workouts in my app, however, I fixed this by going back into the file and fixed the line of code in the beginning of the file which gave me this error. And in general copilot signifigantly sped up my work as the suggestions that copilot would give me when I had written more than half of each line of code were typically right unless I accepted the suggestion and then went back to fix what I really wanted to write. Overall it is a good tool to use however, you still cant just shut your brain off and tell copilot to do everything as it still is not right 100% of the time.
